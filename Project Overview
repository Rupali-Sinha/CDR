### **Project Overview**
CDR specifies charging functionality and management for cellular service providers. This system handles CDR files that contain charging event records, such as voice calls and SMS messages. The goal is to process and store these records while ensuring secure client-server communication.

---

### **Requirements**

1. **Client-Server Connection**  
   A connection must be established between the client and server. This is the initial step for communication.

2. **Client Menu Display**  
   Upon launching the client, a menu should be displayed with the following options:  
   - **Sign Up**  
   - **Log In**  
   - **Exit**  

3. **Server Handling Requests**  
   The server should be able to receive client requests for Sign Up and Log In.

4. **User Registration and Storage**  
   The system must use a structured approach for handling Sign Up and securely store user information in the database.

5. **Post-Login Menu**  
   After a successful login, the user should be presented with the following options:  
   - **Process CDR File**  
   - **Print/Search for Billing Information**  
   - **Logout**  

6. **CDR File Processing**  
   The system should process the CDR file simultaneously using **multi-threading**, handling:  
   - **Customer Billing**  
   - **Interoperator Billing**  

7. **Storing Processed Data**  
   The processed information must be structured and stored for each client session.

8. **Acknowledgment of Processing Completion**  
   After successful processing of the file, the client should receive the confirmation message:  
   `"Processed the CDR data"`  

9. **Billing Data Retrieval Menu**  
   Once processing is completed, the client can choose to retrieve billing information:  
   - **Customer Billing**  
   - **Interoperator Settlement Billing**  

10. **Customer Billing Options**  
    Users should be given the option to:  
    - **Search for MSISDN** to retrieve relevant billing information.  
    - **View all processed Customer Billing data** stored in `CB.txt`.  

11. **Interoperator Settlement Billing Options**  
    Users should be given the option to:  
    - **Search by Brand Name or Operator ID** using MMC/MNC for relevant billing information.  
    - **View all processed Interoperator Billing data** stored in `IOSB.txt`.  

12. **Client Disconnection**  
    The server must close the client socket once the request has been served or the client chooses to exit.

13. **Debug Logging Implementation**  
    The system must include **debug log messages** with at least four levels for monitoring and debugging:  
    - **FATAL**  
    - **INFO**  
    - **WARNING**  
    - **DEBUG**  

    Reference for logging levels: [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2031163/when-to-use-the-different-log-levels)

 Here’s your **Call Data Record (CDR) Processing System** details formatted properly:

---

### **CDR Overview**
CDR specifies charging functionality and management for cellular service providers. This system handles the CDR files that contain records of charging events such as **voice calls** and **SMS messages** with all relevant data.

### **Offline Charging Process**
Offline charging is a method where network resource usage data is collected **concurrently** with the usage itself. The data is passed through logical charging functions, resulting in **CDR files** generated by the network. These files are transferred to the **Billing Domain (BD)** of the network operator for **subscriber billing** and **inter-operator accounting**.

---

### **CDR File Format**
CDR files consist of:
1. **Header Section** – Contains metadata.
2. **CDR Data Section** – Contains **zero or more** concatenated CDR records, each encoded on a **single line**.

Each **CDR record** comprises the following fields, separated by `|`:

- **MSISDN**: A **unique number** identifying a subscription in a mobile network (**max 7 digits**).
- **Operator Brand Name**: A **string (max 64 characters)** (e.g., `"Airtel"`).
- **Operator MMC/MNC**: **Mobile Country Code** and **Mobile Network Code** (**max 6 digits**).
- **Call Type**:
  - **MOC**: Outgoing voice call.
  - **MTC**: Incoming voice call.
  - **SMS-MO**: Outgoing SMS.
  - **SMS-MT**: Incoming SMS.
  - **GPRS**: Internet usage.
- **Duration**: Call duration in **seconds**.
- **Download**: MB **downloaded** (if type is **GPRS**).
- **Upload**: MB **uploaded** (if type is **GPRS**).
- **Third Party MSISDN**: **Corresponding third party number** in this call (**empty for GPRS**).
- **Third Party Operator MMC/MNC**: **Corresponding third party’s mobile operator** in this call.

---

### **Processing Functions**
The system processes **large CDR files (1-5 MB)** for the following tasks:

1. **Customer Billing**
2. **Inter-Operator Settlement**

---

### **Customer Billing**
Each customer is identified by their **MSISDN**, and the following **billing information** is generated:

- **Voice Calls (within the mobile operator)**:
  - **Outgoing voice call durations**.
  - **Incoming voice call durations**.
- **Voice Calls (outside the mobile operator)**:
  - **Outgoing voice call durations**.
  - **Incoming voice call durations**.
- **SMS Messages (within the mobile operator)**:
  - **Sent SMS messages**.
  - **Received SMS messages**.
- **SMS Messages (outside the mobile operator)**:
  - **Sent SMS messages**.
  - **Received SMS messages**.
- **Internet Usage**:
  - **MB downloaded**.
  - **MB uploaded**.

---

### **Print Results**
Each customer’s processed data is displayed in the following format:

```
# Customers Data Base:
Customer ID: 1522840 (JIO)
    * Services within the mobile operator *
    Incoming voice call durations: 0
    Outgoing voice call durations: 0
    Incoming SMS messages: 0
    Outgoing SMS messages: 0

    * Services outside the mobile operator *
    Incoming voice call durations: 0
    Outgoing voice call durations: 312
    Incoming SMS messages: 0
    Outgoing SMS messages: 0

    * Internet use *
    MB downloaded: 0 | MB uploaded: 0
```
